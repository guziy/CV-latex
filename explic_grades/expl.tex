\section*{Grading system at Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT)}
The equivalences of the grades are:
\begin{itemize}
\item excellent - 5
\item good - 4
\item satisfactory - 3
\item failed - 2
\item credit - the course is not graded, but was completed successfully.
\end{itemize}
Credits are not assigned to the classes and cumulative mean is calculated as arithmetic average of all obtained grades (Classes, which are not graded, 
are not taken into account).
