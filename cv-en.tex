\section{Relevant Skills}
\vspace{\vertspace}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Coupled NEMO ocean model and CRCM atmospheric climate model over the Great Lakes region to improve representation of large lakes and 
  to study heavy lake-effect snow events. 
  Using the gossip coupler that was initially developed at ECCC (RPN) and further modified by Michel Valin, in which NEMO and CRCM communicate through shared 
  memory of co-located (on the same node) rank-0 mpi processes of the corresponding parallel models.
  \item Experience running and developing NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean)
  \item Used parallel models WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) and CRCM
  (Canadian Regional Climate Model), and wrote parallel programs in Fortran
  (MPI and OpenMP), Python (multithreading and multiprocessing) and Java (threads).

  \item Used for analysis the following models in standalone mode: CLASS (Canadian Land Surface Scheme), Hostetler (1D lake model) and NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean).

  \item Analysis of large datasets (model simulations and observation datasets) using Python.

  \item Developed a python wrapper for rmnlib (FORTRAN/C library for reading and writing standard RPN files) using ctypes module. 
   The wrapper is available on github at \href{https://github.com/guziy/pylibrmn}{https://github.com/guziy/pylibrmn}.

  \item Developed programs and solved problems using the following programming languages: 
  Python, Java, MATLAB, C/C++, Fortran, R, Linux shell scripting (bash), JavaScript.

  \item Comfortable with git and svn version control systems.

  \item Enthusiastic about open-source Python modules (Basemap, Matplotlib,
  SciPy, Pandas and others) and try to contribute to the development (by
  submitting issues and pull requests) and to the popularization (by answering
  questions on mailing lists or helping with issues submitted to
  issue tracking systems).

  \item Intermediate English and French language skills. 

\end{itemize}
